footnote1="For breaking RSA, based on 'Factoring 2048-bit Numbers in 8 hours using 20 million qubits': https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749'"
footnote2="Needs means: 'this is good enough'. Smaller values can reduce needed number of qubits for a single logical qubit."
footnote3="This is the number of needed qubits for a logical qubit based on the error rate and the number of operations expected to be performed."
